''' 
The plot appears to show Espanola and Magnirostris having a higher average beak distance from the outgroup with a lower average gene distance. This contradicts how Genesova and Difficilis have a higher average gene distance with a lower average beak distance. This again points to how Espanola and Magnirostris, while mixed together, were visually seperated from Genesova and Difficilis which were mixed as well.
